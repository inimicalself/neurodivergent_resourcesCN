## Jargon 
OMIM - online mendelian inheritance in man

ACMG guidance - American college of medical genetics and genomics

SIFT - Predict effects of nonsynonymous / missense variants

Haploinsufficiency -  A situation in which the total level of a gene product (a particular protein) produced by the cell is about half of the normal level and that is not sufficient to permit the cell to function normally.

cis phasing/cis phase - two different alleles on the same chromosomes that are both dominant or recessive, e.g. AABB  or aabb.

trans phasing/trans phase - two different alleles on the same chromosomes where one of which is dominant, the other is recessive. E.g AAbb, aaBB

## Baseline
SUBJECT: Temple Grandin (TG)

METHOD: chromosomal microarray analysis, WES, WGS. Clinical, family history

MEDICAL HISTORY: HFA, non-verbal at 2 1/2, began talking at 3 1/2 and fully verbal by 4. Maintain repetitive behaviour and sensory overload. Difficult social interaction. Digasnose autism in elem school. IQ (full scale Weshsler 120 age 9, 137 age 12. Excelled in visualisation: block design and puzzle gifted, auditory integration disabled. 

No family history of ASD. Maternal grandmother medicated for anxiety and father suspected HFASD. Maternal grandfather was an engineer with a college degree. 

Other conditions: chronic myalgia (muscle pain),  muscle rigidity, paresthesia (abnormal sensations), hyperesthesia (excessive physical sensitivity) of the feet. Tires with exercise, coordination difficulties, insomnia, severe anxiety and panic attacks, a diet high in animal protein, reduce results in perceive irritability.  Rash with eczema and psoriasis-like features, widow’s peak, asymmetry of ventricles (heart structure), reduction in cerebellum size. Microdontia (smaller teeth) and hypodontia (missing teeth). 6 adult teeth.  Additional ectodermal dysplasia (ED): brittle nails, hyperhidrosis (more sweat).

## Result
28% of neurodevelopmental patients have one or more abnormal CNVs. In TG, no pathogenic or likely pathogenic CNVs found. But found some structural variants (deletion, duplications, inversion, LOH [loss of heterozygosity], breakpoints, insertion, transposable element, 

Heterozygous duplication of chr9q34… include several noncoding genes and exons of Ca channel gene *CACNA1B*, that is associated with neurodevelopmental disorder w seizures and nonepileptic hyperkinetic movements (autosomal recessive severe neurologic disorder: delayed psychomotor development with the inability to walk or speak, early-onset refractory seizures…)

Fragile x repeat normal. Suspected ASD risk genes *SHANK2, ALX1, and RELN* actually not met ACMG GUIDANCE as variants of pathogenic or likely pathogenic designation (?) thus classified as uncertain significance (VUS).

A heterozygous missense variant in *SHANK2* was identified. and Predicted by SIFT to be deleterious (harmful).  -> HAPLOINSUFFICIENCY. 

Several studies suggest and harbour de novo variant in *SHANK2* enrichment of variants in ASD 3.4% vs control 1.5%, p = 0.004.  suggest a role of synaptic gene dysfunction in ASD.

Heterozygous missense variant in *ALX1* gene. *ALX1* encodes TF plays role in development: proper neural crest migration in animals, Bi-allelic l-o-f variants in *ALX1* cause frontonasal dysplasia, g-o-f variants suspected to impact neurodevelopment. TG’s craniofacial widow’s peak could be related to this, hair follicles contain neural crest cells. This variant freq 0.004285. also several potential ASD risks variant in TG’s case.  Researchers showed a potential risk factor of this gene.

### Genetic variants and links to phenotypes in TG
*MEFV* two heterozygous variants reported being disease-related. One is suspected to direct white blood cells to sites of inflammation and downregulate inflammatory response. *MEFV* associated with familial Mediterranean fever (fmf_ A HIGHLY COMPLEX AND VARIABLE CONDITION, can be autosomal dominant or recessive. variants in linkage disequilibrium  (cis phasing)?  over 80 variants found together, TG did not meet clinical criteria for Fmf but consistent with the atypical presentation of the condition： paresthesia in both feet, lifelong skin rashes diagnosed as eczema. FMF did not report associated w ASD, but inflammation is one of many pathways implemented in ASD pathogenesis and can not exclude asRF for ASD in TG.

*WNT10A* gene variant overlap with the TG phenotype. A homozygous variant, pathogenic. This gene member of the *WNT* gene family, encodes several developmental processes, including regulation of cell fate and patterning during embryogenesis. Problem: isolated oligodontia, tooth agenesis, other features of ectodermal dysplasia (ED). Her variant present in more than half of the cases of isolated Oligodontia. Her variant could possibly explain multiple ed like manifestations in TG: teeth, nails, hair and sweat glands.

### Low risks of ASD in PRS algorithm
Using a polygenic risk score (RPS) algorithm (impute.me) showed TG’s PRS for ASD lower than 99% and 1% of the general population by assessing 17 SNPs previously reported to be associated with ASD (* Grove, J.; Ripke, S.; Als, T.D.; Mattheisen, M.; Walters, R.K.; Won, H.; Pallesen, J.; Agerbo, E.; A Andreassen, O.; Anney, R.; et al.

## Discussion
### Variants related to ASD
Identify variants of unknown significance in 3 ASD risk genes, and other variants that impact gene that is possibly relevant to ASD pathology (the science of the causes and effects of diseases). PRS model only 1st percentile of gen pop. (The tool indicated genetic liability captured by the assessment is ~1%) 

### PRS algorithm biases
Several reasons for this tool: Derived from cases cohort diagnosed with ASD prior to 2014, probably more representative of lower functioning individuals. (But we don’t know how they contributing to ASD. ASD is clearly polygenic. So low PRS, for ASD can not be ruled out the potential for a future clinical diagnosis. 

### Genetic testing benefits
Genetic testing identifies actionable variant that can be addressed in order to improve symptoms and prevent further medical issues. 
Genetic testing provides medicine guides. 
reinterpretation of raw data as the advancement of research
Genetic testing challenges
lack of trained clinical experts interpret data and discover disease-associated factors (Require training).
feasibility of a “genomics board”, long waiting lists o consultation, licensure barriers,
professional and practical consultation not available in low-cost exome and genome testings
insurance controversies and clinicians not utilising genetic reports. 
Conclusion
Genetic etiology (disease reason)  in TG could result from a combination of multiple genetic factors interacting in order to yield the observed clinical features. 

## 要点
**基因检测发现了可能导致高功能孤独症人士TG的相关突变，但突变具体如何导致其孤独症尚不明确。**

1947年出生，TG两岁半无语言，四岁才学会说话。重复局限行为和感官超载持续，并伴有社交困难。小学时被诊断为孤独症，12岁韦氏全量表IQ137，并在 视觉方面，如模块设计的天赋超常，而听觉处理能力则低下。

对TG的罕见突变基因的筛查中没有发现异常的CNV，但有碱基删除、重复、杂合性缺失等结构性变异。突变中有3个基因：*SHANK2，ALX1，RELN* 都已被认为与ASD相关 （虽然TG本人的突变位点后果并不明确）。而在其他突变中则发现了导致TG和牙齿形态异常，肌肉疼痛 和感觉异常（*MEFV*）等症状的原因。MEFV基因有炎症应对调控的功能，虽然MEFV未曾被提出与ASD相关，但炎症却是ASD发病机理中的许多途径之一。因此文章提出该基因也可能导致了TG的ASD。

**对于TG, 基因检测明确找到了她的一些（常认为不属于ASD的）慢性病原因**，和不同药物的代谢能力，因此能获得更合适的医学和用药指导。并且随着将来研究的深入，个人基因数据仍有很多被解读的空间。

但目前基因检测对于ASD人士有太多挑战。最主要的问题有：基因检测不能判定是ASD与否，譬如研究中使用的算法impute.me 遗传风险算法显示TG的ASD风险小于1%的大众人群 （该工具称只能解释1%的ASD）。其次，能够解读基因原始数据的专业人士太少，价格昂贵以及普通人咨询排号队长。另外还普遍存在医生不使用基因检测报告结合患者症状的情况和保险纠纷。

一般认为，ASD属于多基因遗传：由多种基因突变的累积、和其交互效应所导致。 TG的基因检测结果也符合这些特点。但通过检测基因来判定ASD，挑战仍然有很多。首先是比如研究里使用的impute.me 遗传风险算法，结果显示TG的ASD风险小于1%的大众人群，**总而来说，我个人认为目前基因检测对于像TG这样的“高功能”ASD人士的好处并不比对普通人多。**
